Run command ':rr' to execute code from this slide
Double will be defined in the session so you can also try to run 'double 10' after that

Start the line with code with '>>>'
If let is needed to properly execute code in ghci and you don't want to show it on the slide start with 'L>>'


L>>double x = x + x

>>>putStrLn . show $ double 5
---
Multiline code also works
'H>>' will add code to the slide but code will be not visible in the presentation

H>>:m +Data.Char
>>>do putStrLn "Give me your name"
>>>   name <- getLine
>>>   putStr "Welcome to Howepoint, "
>>>   putStrLn $ map toUpper name
