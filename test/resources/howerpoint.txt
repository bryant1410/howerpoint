Run command \k\W':rr'\0 to execute code from this slide
Double will be defined in the session so you can also try to run 'double 10' after that

Start the line with code with \k\W'>>>'
If let is needed to properly execute code in ghci and you don't want to show it on the slide start with \k\W'L>>'


L>>double x = x + x

>>>putStrLn . show $ double 5

Multiline code also works
\k\W'H>>'\0 will add code to the slide but code will be not visible in the presentation

H>>:m +Data.Char
>>>do putStrLn "Give me your name"
>>>   name <- getLine
>>>   putStr "Welcome to Howepoint, "
>>>   putStrLn $ map toUpper name
